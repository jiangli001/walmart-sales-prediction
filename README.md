# Predicting Walmart Sales

Provided by Kaggle, the dataset is “Walmart Recruiting – Store Sales Forecasting.” The challenge that we face is how to make business decisions based on limited history. Specifically, our final goal is to predict weekly sales of each of the stores based on other variables. Predicting sales is important because managers can do inventory management better and plan for promotions when there is expected to be a dip in sales. Sales forecasting can also largely help a retail company to boost its profit.
           
The dataset includes information of 45 Walmart stores in different regions. Each store has different departments and each store has different sizes. The variables include weekly sales, date, temperature, fuel price, CPI, unemployment, markdowns, and whether it is a holiday. We hope to find out as many patterns as possible among those variables.
           
First, we described the findings from preliminary analysis based on the graphs plotted as well as the correlations between variables. Then, we used other more advanced methods to predict the sales -- random forest, neural network, gradient boosting machine, and time series analysis. By using these models, we are able to predict the weekly sales analytically.
